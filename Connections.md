The main three parts to be accomplished are the main code that includes
lists of the words, and if/then statements for whether or not the screen will
show a correct or incorrect connection. Another part will be creating a randomization function
so that we can have shuffling capabilites. Finally, the third person will work on GUI
once we learn how to do that.
