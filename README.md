## Short description: 
like the new york times connection game.
## Why: 
Fun game to try and code
## Inspiration: 
NYT Connections game

The main two parts to be accomplished are the main code that includes
lists of the words, and if/then statements for whether or not the screen will
show a correct or incorrect connection. Another part will be working on the GUI
once we learn how to do that. We will both likely work together on all of these
parts to complete the whole project.
